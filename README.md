# next.calc issue tracker 🚛

Hey! Here's a helpful little issue tracker for known issues with **[next.calc]([https://apolloapp.io](https://jangelsb.github.io/next.calc/))**, so if you have a bug or a feature to report you can check the “Issues” tab up above to see if it's already been reported. I'm just one guy working on next.calc so I can't promise I'll work on it instantly, but I do really want to know about the bugs and feature requests so I can work on them as soon as I can! 

### How do I report a bug or feature request?

To create a report, you'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), which is super fast (and free) to do.

Then just click here: **[Create a new Issue](https://github.com/jangelsb/next.calc-issues/issues/new/choose)**

Then simply fill in the form. *Please* make sure you include as much of the requested information as possible, it helps me out a ton! Please be polite in the discussions as well.

### How do I find out if my bug  or feature has already been reported?

Go to the “[Issues](https://github.com/jangelsb/next.calc-issues/issues)” tab at the top, and there's a search bar at the top so you can search to see if it's already been submitted. If not, report away! If it has been reported though feel free to add more information to the discussion, or you can tap the + button with the 👍 emoji to vote on it to indicate it affects you too. 

### What can I do to help if the bug I'm having an issue with has already been reported?

A massive part of solving a bug is just about reproducing it, which just means being able to consistently make it happen. If I can't make it happen, it's super hard to solve! So if you can make it happen and try to figure out the steps that always make it happen, please post those as a comment on the discussion, it'll help so much!

### Why do I need to sign up for an account here?

GitHub's an awesome site that's really well-suited for bug tracking. It'll keep things more organized than having bug bug discussions, feature requests, memes, announcement posts, and more all in the subreddit. Having to sign up for an account is super quick though and helps cut down on spam, so it's worth it, trust me! [Sign Up](https://github.com/)

### Can I participate in discussions here?

Of course! But please try to stay on topic to the specific bug report, so contribute if you feel you can add extra information. If you just want to say "me too", use the + button with the smiley on a comment to indicate your reaction rather than creating another comment. This is unfortunately also not the place for off-topic conversation or memes. Also please try to be nice here within the discussions. :)
